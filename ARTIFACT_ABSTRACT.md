# Mining Software Defects: Should We Consider Affected Releases?

**Abstract**

This artifact includes a collection of new benchmark defect datasets and R scripts for replicating our paper.
We are applying for REPLICATED badge with the following reasons: (1) our replication package and defect datasets are available at an Rnalytica R package and [Zenodo](https://github.com/awsm-research/replication-icse2019); (2) our replication package and defect datasets are reusable when one wishes to repeat the experiemnt with datasets from other domains and ecosystems; and (3) we believe that the main results of the paper is repeatable and replicable when using our provided defect datasets and R scripts. 
R programming knowledge is required to replicate the main results of our paper.
